## Recent Changes

### 2026-05-04 — Step 16 Phase A re-review

Reviewer re-audit after Implementer's blocker fixes. Source of truth: `specs/features/16-ethical-gamification.md` ("Shared Gamification Core", "Aesthetic Variants", "Variant: Classic Boring"). No source code modified.

**✅ Pass (6)**
- Blocker 1 closed: `src/i18n/locales/{ca,es,en}/onboarding.json` ship `appearance.variant.{classic_boring,retro_platformer}.{label,description}` (12 leaves) verbatim from `common:settings.appearance.variant.*`. `AppearanceSelector` resolves them via the `onboarding` namespace + `appearance` keyPrefix — no raw key strings rendered.
- Blocker 2 closed: `vitest.config.ts` (jsdom, scoped to `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`); devDeps `vitest`/`jsdom`/`@testing-library/{react,jest-dom}`; `package.json` scripts `test`, `test:unit`, `test:ingestion` wired. The 3 mandated tests (`userStore.migration`, `useEffectiveAestheticVariant`, `userStore.isValidUserConfig`) are present and structurally valid.
- Warning 1 closed: `●` badge removed from `AppearanceSelector.tsx`; `effectiveVariant` prop dropped from API and call sites.
- Warning 2 closed: Onboarding `handleSkip` explicitly calls `setAestheticVariant(DEFAULT_AESTHETIC_VARIANT)` before `goNext()`.
- No regressions: shared-core invariants intact; reduced-motion override remains runtime-only and never written; a11y, security, conventions preserved.
- Gates wiring verified for `i18n:check`, `lint`, `build`, `test`.

**⚠️ Warnings (1, non-blocking)**
- Onboarding `appearance.subtitle` and `appearance.reduced_motion_forced` are intentionally shorter than the Settings counterparts. By design — flagged only for future cross-surface copy parity if desired.

**❌ Blockers (0)**

**Verdict:** PASS. Phase A implementation complete. Phases B–E remain pending; Step 16 row stays "🚧 In Progress".

### 2026-05-04 — Step 16 Phase A blocker fixes

Implementer pass addressing the two blockers and two selected warnings from the 2026-05-04 reviewer audit. Spec untouched.

**Blocker 1 — onboarding i18n parity for `variant.*` subtree.** Mirrored `common:settings.appearance.variant.{classic_boring,retro_platformer}.{label,description}` into `onboarding:appearance.variant.*` for ca/es/en (12 leaves). Copy is verbatim from the corresponding `common.json` keys; no new strings invented. `AppearanceSelector` keeps reading `appearance.variant.<key>.{label,description}` from the namespace passed in by its caller (`onboarding` for the optional onboarding step, `common` for Settings).

**Blocker 2 — A8 unit tests + Vitest infra.** Added Vitest + jsdom + `@testing-library/react` + `@testing-library/jest-dom`. New `vitest.config.ts` scopes the runner to `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` so the existing Node-test ingestion suite is untouched. Scripts: `test:unit` runs Vitest, `test:ingestion` keeps the Node runner, and `test` runs both sequentially.

Tests (all passing):
- `src/stores/userStore.isValidUserConfig.test.ts` — 6 cases. Accepts string and `undefined`, rejects number/object/null/boolean for `aestheticVariant`.
- `src/stores/userStore.migration.test.ts` — mocks `@/services/db/configRepository`, calls `loadUserConfig` with a legacy `UserConfig` lacking `aestheticVariant`, asserts the store hydrates to `DEFAULT_AESTHETIC_VARIANT` and the rest of the fields round-trip cleanly.
- `src/hooks/useEffectiveAestheticVariant.test.tsx` — `renderHook` against a stubbed `window.matchMedia`. Asserts (a) reduced-motion → returns `'classic-boring'` while persisted `'retro-platformer'` is preserved and `setAestheticVariant` is never called, and (b) the no-override path returns the persisted variant.

**Warning 1 — redundant `●` badge.** Removed the amber dot from `AppearanceSelector` (the radio's `checked` state already conveys "active"). Dropped the now-unused `effectiveVariant` prop from the component and from both call sites (`Settings`, `Onboarding`), plus the dead `useEffectiveAestheticVariant` import in those pages.

**Warning 2 — explicit Skip intent.** Onboarding's Skip button now calls `setAestheticVariant(DEFAULT_AESTHETIC_VARIANT)` before advancing, so the persisted choice reflects the user's (implicit) decision rather than relying on a pre-existing default. Imported `DEFAULT_AESTHETIC_VARIANT` from `@/types/user`.

**Files added**
- `vitest.config.ts`
- `src/stores/userStore.isValidUserConfig.test.ts`
- `src/stores/userStore.migration.test.ts`
- `src/hooks/useEffectiveAestheticVariant.test.tsx`

**Files modified**
- `src/i18n/locales/{ca,es,en}/onboarding.json` — added `appearance.variant.*` subtree
- `src/components/ui/AppearanceSelector.tsx` — removed `●` badge and `effectiveVariant` prop
- `src/pages/Onboarding/index.tsx` — explicit `handleSkip`, dropped dead hook import + prop
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` — dropped dead hook import + `effectiveVariant` prop
- `package.json` — added `vitest`/`@testing-library/react`/`@testing-library/jest-dom`/`jsdom` devDeps; `test` runs both suites; new `test:unit`
- `tasks/todo.md` — A8 ticked
- `specs/STATUS.md` — Phase A entry updated to "awaiting re-review" (FAIL annotation removed)

**Verification**
- `npm run i18n:check` → `[i18n:check] OK — 3 locales, 6 namespaces in parity.`
- `npm run lint` → exit 0 (no output)
- `npm run build` → `✓ built in 7.57s` then PWA `precache 7 entries`
- `npm test` → `Test Files 3 passed (3) / Tests 9 passed (9)` for `test:unit`; `tests 3 / pass 3 / fail 0` for `test:ingestion`

**Deviations from brief**
- Added 6 cases (not just 1) to `isValidUserConfig` to exhaustively cover the contract — same file, no extra surface area.
- Removed `effectiveVariant` from the `AppearanceSelector` API rather than leaving it as a dead prop, since the `●` badge was its only consumer. This eliminates two unused imports and keeps `noUnusedParameters` honest.
- Did not install `@testing-library/jest-dom`'s matchers via a setup file (no DOM matchers needed by these three tests). The package is installed per the brief but no global setup is wired; future tests can add it as needed.

### 2026-05-04 — Step 16 Phase A review

Reviewer pass against `specs/features/16-ethical-gamification.md` ("Shared Gamification Core", "Aesthetic Variants", "Variant: Classic Boring") and `tasks/todo.md` → "Step 16 — Phase A". No source code modified.

**✅ Pass**
- Shared core: single `aestheticVariant` field on existing `UserConfig`; zero variant-specific logic; zero new IDB stores.
- `AestheticVariant` is an open string type; default `DEFAULT_AESTHETIC_VARIANT = 'classic-boring'`.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` enforcement is purely runtime (`useEffectiveAestheticVariant` derives, never writes); persisted preference is preserved across toggles.
- `userStore`: legacy configs without `aestheticVariant` hydrate to default; `setAestheticVariant`, `completeOnboarding`, `reset` round-trip the field; `isValidUserConfig` accepts optional string only.
- `usePrefersReducedMotion`: SSR-safe, syncs after mount, `addEventListener('change', …)` with `addListener` fallback, full cleanup.
- Settings: dedicated "Aspecte" section with reduced-motion banner (`role="status"`); selector disabled while persisted choice remains visible.
- Onboarding: optional first step with Skip/Back/Next; default-on-skip behavior is `classic-boring`.
- Guardrails: no guilt/urgency/shame copy; no paid gating; no telemetry.
- Accessibility: radio-group semantics, `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby`, AA-friendly amber banner, 44px+ tap targets.
- Security: no `any`, no `innerHTML`/`eval`, no logged secrets.

**❌ Blockers**
- `src/i18n/locales/{ca,es,en}/onboarding.json`: missing keys `appearance.variant.classic_boring.{label,description}` and `appearance.variant.retro_platformer.{label,description}` (12 leaves). `AppearanceSelector` reads from the `onboarding` namespace at the optional onboarding step; `npm run i18n:check` does not catch it because parity holds and no namespace fallback is configured. **Fix:** mirror the `variant.*` subtree from `common:settings.appearance` into `onboarding:appearance` for ca/es/en.
- A8 unit tests not delivered. No frontend test runner is configured in `package.json` (`test` only runs ingestion). Missing: (1) `userStore` migration without `aestheticVariant`, (2) `useEffectiveAestheticVariant` does not mutate the store under reduced-motion override, (3) `isValidUserConfig` rejects non-string `aestheticVariant`. **Fix:** add Vitest + jsdom and the three tests, or formally descope A8.

**⚠️ Warnings (non-blocking)**
- `AppearanceSelector` "active now" `●` badge has no accessible name. Either remove or label.
- Onboarding Skip and Next call the same handler. Recommend Skip explicitly call `setAestheticVariant(DEFAULT_AESTHETIC_VARIANT)` so intent is encoded, not implicit.
- A8 manual smoke (toggle OS reduced-motion) not recorded. Add note on re-verification.

**Verdict:** FAIL. Implementer to address blockers and re-request review.

### 2026-05-04 — Step 16 pre-execution gates

Pre-execution phases for Step 16 (Ethical Gamification) executed by the Architect agent. No source code touched. Source of truth: `specs/features/16-ethical-gamification.md` (recently extended with "Shared Gamification Core", "Aesthetic Variants", and "Variant: Classic Boring" sections).

**Phase 0 — Source-Of-Truth & Dependency Check.** Steps 8, 9, 14 confirmed ✅ in `specs/STATUS.md`. The feature spec has no internal contradictions. `tasks/todo.md` had no Step 16 items prior to this gate; no contradictions introduced.

**Phase 1 — Behavioral Risk Brief (Phase A only).** Mechanics evaluated: `aestheticVariant` field (low), Settings selector (low), onboarding optional step (low–medium — mitigated by skippable + default-on-skip + descriptive copy), `prefers-reduced-motion` enforcement (medium — mitigated by deriving the effective variant at runtime and never writing the forced value to IDB, plus a Settings notice). No high-risk mechanic in Phase A.

**Phase 2 — UI/UX Integrity Gate. Decision: INCREMENTAL.** Phase A only adds plumbing (one persisted field, one selector section, one optional onboarding step, one reduced-motion hook). It reskins no surface. Existing `UserConfig`, `userStore`, `Settings.tsx`, and `Onboarding/index.tsx` support these additions cleanly without IA refactor. The full UI/UX refactor policy is deferred to Phase B (Dashboard map/calendar reskin) where the IA actually changes.

**Phase 3 — Mechanic Design & Event Model (Phase A).**
- `UserConfig.aestheticVariant?: 'retro-platformer' | 'classic-boring' | string`, default `'classic-boring'`, exported as `DEFAULT_AESTHETIC_VARIANT`.
- Migration for existing users: optional field; on read, missing values fall back to `'classic-boring'`. No write-back pass.
- Settings UI: new "Aspecte / Apariencia / Appearance" section with radio cards, shared-core clarification copy, and a reduced-motion banner.
- Onboarding contract: optional appearance step inserted before Step3Context; "Omet" leaves default `'classic-boring'`.
- Reduced-motion detection: `usePrefersReducedMotion` hook subscribed to `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')`; effective variant resolved by `useEffectiveAestheticVariant`. The persisted value is never overwritten by the override.
- i18n keys added to ca/es/en under `common:settings.appearance.*` and `onboarding:appearance.*` (shared-core notice and reduced-motion forced notice copy verbatim from the spec).
- Event model: zero new telemetry, zero new IDB stores (Guardrail #10).

**Phase 4 — Implementation Plan Gate.** Ordered Phase A plan with acceptance criteria recorded in `tasks/todo.md` (steps A1–A10, including unit tests and verification gates).

**Open questions / blockers:** none. Implementer agent may proceed with Phase A as written. Phases B–E remain blocked behind their respective design gates.

### Comprehensive Code Review Pass — 30+ Fixes (2026-04-30)

End-to-end review of `src/` plus targeted ingestion follow-ups. Performed in
four rounds (initial sweep → user-selected refactors → regression repair →
remaining items). All rounds end with `npm run build`, `npm run lint`,
`npm run i18n:check`, and `npm test` (ingestion suite) green.

**Critical bug fixes**

- Date/UTC drift: `toDateStr` rewritten to use local components; new
  `parseLocalYMD` helper; `getISOWeek` reimplemented per ISO 8601 (Thursday
  pivot, Jan-4 anchor) — eliminates wrong week labels at year boundaries and
  in non-UTC timezones.
- `aggregateAdherence` now walks ISO weeks via `listISOWeeksBetween`, filling
  empty weeks with `completed: 0` instead of skipping them.
- Planning engine: 1-week deload guard; `resolveWeekMultiplier` reordered so
  per-week rates apply on the deload week too; sets/reps/weight all honour
  `weeklyProgressionRates` consistently when present (legacy slider mode
  retains the constant `rule.deloadPercentage`).
- `mesocycleRepository.saveActiveMesocycle` performs the
  swap-active-flag-then-put inside a single `readwrite` transaction.
- `exportImport.importData` validates every record before clearing IDB stores;
  `exportData` revokes the object URL in `finally`.
- `sessionStore.finishSession` now caches `{ sessionId, completedAt }` in
  `pendingSessionDraft` so a retry after a partial save reuses the same row
  rather than inserting a duplicate.
- `userStore.isValidUserConfig` validates `trainingDays` (array of numbers) and
  `availableWeights` (object) — not just equipment + minutesPerSession.

**UX/perf refactors**

- `RestTimer` self-subscribes to `restSecondsRemaining` + `tickRest`; removed
  from `useSession` API to stop the per-second tick re-rendering the whole
  Session page tree. `useSession` slice uses `useShallow` excluding
  tick-frequency fields.
- `sessionStore` exposes `skipRest` and `finishEarly` actions (replacing
  `useSessionStore.setState({...})` from the page).
- `BottomNav` hides itself during an active session.
- `WeightSelector` accepts comma decimal separator (`'1,5' → 1.5`).
- `useExercises` exposes a `retry()` action so consumers can recover from a
  failed initial catalog load without a full page reload.
- `Modal` and `Settings` defensive cleanup of timers/refs to avoid
  use-after-unmount.
- `Onboarding` finish button disabled until equipment + trainingDays selected.
- `WeightSelector` and `weightSnapping` use a small epsilon for floating-point
  weight comparisons.

**Catalog & validation hardening**

- `exerciseCatalog` URL uses `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`; new `isValidExercise`
  type guard filters malformed records (DEV-gated `console.warn`).
- `Card`/`LoadingSpinner` props interfaces exported.
- `LLMAssistant` and `llmAssistantService` size and CSV-injection guards
  tightened.
- `userStore.detectLanguage` whitelists `ca/es/en`.

**Ingestion**

- Removed `autoRestrictions` from `Preset` interface and downstream consumers
  (`src/data/presets.ts`), as well as from ingestion `CanonicalPreset`,
  `PresetCandidateInput`, `normalizers`, `validators`, `presetGenerator`
  (including the LLM prompt example schema), and `llmJsonAdapter`. Existing
  preset JSON files in `data/ingestion/presets/*.json` retain the field as a
  no-op (silently ignored) for backward compatibility.

**Tooling**

- New `scripts/checkI18nParity.ts` + `npm run i18n:check` script: flattens
  every locale namespace and reports missing/extra keys against `ca`.

### Step 19 — QA Pass Build Repair (2026-04-28)

A previous implementer began the Round-2 QA Pass for Feature 17 but left the
TypeScript build with 20 errors. Restored a green build and finished the two
QA tracks that were already mid-flight:

- **QA-5 (equipment overhaul, partial)**: removed every `'pilates'` literal
  from runtime code (`PlanCreator`'s local `ALL_EQUIPMENT`, `Settings.tsx`,
  `Onboarding/Step3Context.tsx`, `llmAssistantService` `EQUIPMENT_LABELS`
  map). `PlanCreator`, `Settings`, and `Step3Context` now consume
  `EQUIPMENT_CATALOG`/`ALL_EQUIPMENT` from `src/data/equipmentCatalog.ts`
  via the existing `EquipmentChipSelector`. Equipment label map now covers
  the full extended `Equipment` enum.
- **QA-6 (remove user restrictions)**: dropped `activeRestrictions` from all
  call sites — `UserConfig` literals in `PlanCreator`, store selectors in
  `PlanCreator`/`Dashboard`/`Settings`/`Step3Context`, `LLMAssistant`
  prompt params, `convertToMesocycle` (parameter removed), and
  `exerciseFilter`'s `excludeRestrictions` field removed from filter calls.
  Removed the restrictions UI section in both `Step3Context.tsx` and
  `Settings.tsx`. Removed obsolete `step3.restrictions` and
  `step3.restrictionOptions` keys from `ca/es/en` `onboarding.json`.
  `Dashboard.tsx` `generateSession(...)` call sites trimmed to the
  4-argument signature.

Verified: `npm run build` and `npm run lint` both green.

Outstanding QA items (still open after this fix-up): QA-1 sparkline copy
+ tooltip, QA-2 translated save errors, QA-3 wizard reorder, QA-4
`PresetPreviewModal` wiring (component file exists but is not yet
imported by `PlanCreator`), QA-5 i18n keys for new equipment values,
QA-7 faithful-only enforcement + runtime validator + autofill CTA,
and faithful regeneration of `data/ingestion/presets/catalog.json`.

### Step 19 — Preset & Session Template Redesign (2026-04-24)

Implementation of Feature 17 (`specs/features/17-preset-sessions-redesign.md`), tracked as Step 19 in STATUS.md.

**Phases completed:**
1. Types + DATA_MODEL stub — `TemplateKey`, `WeekProgressionRate`, updated `PresetSessionTemplate` (`templateKey` + `name`, no `label`), `initialLoadKg` on `PresetExerciseEntry`, `weeklyProgressionRates` on `CustomPreset` and `Preset`.
2. Planning engine — `resolveWeekMultiplier` helper; both `generateFaithfulMesocycle` and `generateGeneratorMesocycle` consume per-week rates with absolute multiplier semantics; faithful mode uses `entry.initialLoadKg` when defined and > 0.
3. A/B/C/D tabs in `FaithfulExercisesStep.tsx` — always-4 templates, inline name field, copy-to dropdown, reps fixed/range toggle, initial load input, up/down reorder.
4. `WeekProgressionTable` component + PlanCreator configure step — slider replaced by per-week table; gray dashed "Custom" grid card removed; `weeks` change preserves edited rows and pads with defaults.
5. Auto-fork built-in presets → CustomPreset on "Save as preset" only; inline name field in wizard header (required, non-empty); legacy `weeklyProgression` write-back migration on first IndexedDB load; unsaved-changes guard via `dirty` flag and confirmation prompt on `guardedNavigate`.
6. i18n — added template/preset keys to `ca/es/en` planning namespace; removed `planning:custom` and `planning:custom_desc`; all three locales synced (107 keys each); DATA_MODEL.md updated with full final type definitions.

**Key decisions baked in:**
- Auto-fork is explicit-only: triggered by "Save as preset", never on intermediate edits.
- Required inline name field gates the save action for built-in working copies and from-scratch presets.
- Legacy `weeklyProgression` is migrated by writing back per-week rates (`progressionPct = weeklyProgression`, `-40` for `week % 4 === 0`) to IndexedDB on first load — no further reliance on the slider.
- Default rates: `+5%` per week, `-40%` for `week % 4 === 0`.
- `weeklyProgressionRates` semantics are absolute per week (`1 + pct/100`), not cumulative — explicit per-week control.
- Reps stored as `number | [number, number]` with a UI toggle for fixed vs range.
- Reorder via up/down arrow buttons only (no drag-and-drop).
- Existing exercise picker reused as-is from `FaithfulExercisesStep`.
- Unsaved-changes confirmation uses `window.confirm` with i18n strings (minimal footprint; can be upgraded to a Tailwind modal as a future polish).

**Files created:**
- `src/components/planning/WeekProgressionTable.tsx`
- `src/services/planning/presetTemplates.ts`

**Files modified:**
- `src/types/planning.ts`
- `src/data/presets.ts`
- `src/services/planning/planningEngine.ts`
- `src/stores/planningStore.ts`
- `src/components/planning/PlanCreator.tsx`
- `src/components/planning/FaithfulExercisesStep.tsx`
- `src/i18n/locales/{ca,es,en}/planning.json`
- `specs/STATUS.md`, `specs/STATUS_HISTORY.md`, `specs/DATA_MODEL.md`

**Verification:** `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite + PWA generation). i18n key parity confirmed across `ca/es/en` (107 keys). Removed legacy keys (`custom`, `custom_desc`) absent from all locale files.

**Out of scope (intentional):** Step 16 (Ethical Gamification) deferred per user request.

### Step 18 Review Fixes — Ingestion Pipeline Consistency (2026-04-10)

**4 issues fixed:**
1. `data/ingestion/llm-example.json`: Migrated preset from `exerciseIds` array to `sessions[]` format
2. `scripts/ingestion/presetGenerator.ts`: Split inline Claude contract into two separate examples (generator-mode with muscleDistribution only, faithful-mode with sessions only)
3. `scripts/ingestion/validators.ts`: Made `muscleDistribution` non-empty check conditional — skipped when `sessions` is present and non-empty
4. `scripts/ingestion/adapters/llmJsonAdapter.ts`: Enforced reps tuple shape — array with exactly 2 elements becomes `[number, number]`, otherwise falls back to single number

**6 warnings resolved:**
1. `data/ingestion/prompts/presets-llm-chat.prompt.txt`: Aligned sets (1–10), restSeconds (0–600) ranges with validator
2. `scripts/ingestion/presetGenerator.ts`: Changed `weeklyProgression: 2.5` to integer `3`
3. `data/ingestion/prompts/presets-llm-chat.prompt.txt`: Documented reps as integer or `[min, max]` range array
4. `data/ingestion/prompts/presets-output.json`: Changed Plank `reps: 1` to `reps: 45` (seconds-based)
5. `scripts/ingestion/presetGenerator.ts`: Added comment referencing prompt file near inline contract
6. `scripts/ingestion/contracts.ts`: Added sync comments to `PresetExerciseEntry` and `PresetSessionTemplate`

**Build:** `npm run build` passes with zero errors.

### Tooling Support — Catalog-Driven Preset + Exercise UI Sources (2026-04-09)
- **Changed**: `src/data/presets.ts` runtime preset building now renders directly from `data/ingestion/presets/catalog.json` parsed entries, removing hardcoded fallback merges from the UI data path.
- **Verified**: Existing built-in presets rendered by UI are present in the ingestion preset catalog (`corredor_general`, `pujada`, `rehab_tendinitis_anserina`, `forca_general`, `mobilitat_prevencio`).
- **Added**: `src/services/exercises/exerciseCatalog.ts` as a minimal adapter for exercise catalog source configuration and payload parsing.
- **Changed**: `src/services/exercises/exerciseLoader.ts` now consumes the exercise catalog through the adapter (`EXERCISE_CATALOG_URL` + parser) to keep runtime source explicit and catalog-driven.
- **Changed**: `scripts/buildExercises.ts` now writes using `EXERCISE_CATALOG_PATH` from `scripts/ingestion/paths.ts`, keeping build-time exercise output aligned with ingestion merge targets.
- **Verification**:
  - `npm run ingest -- --config data/ingestion/sources.example.json --dry-run` passes (run `ingestion-20260409-203225-5402c6`: accepted 557, skipped 218, duplicate 100, rejected 0)
  - `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite + PWA generation)

### Tooling Support — Focused Ingestion Tests + Artifact Hygiene (2026-04-09)
- **Added**: Minimal deterministic ingestion test command in `package.json` (`test:ingestion`) powered by the existing `tsx` toolchain.
- **Added**: Focused tests in `scripts/ingestion/i18nMerge.test.ts` covering:
  - grouped update precedence for canonical exercise i18n merges (deterministic source ordering, first non-empty locale value resolution, deterministic tag sorting)
  - `validateLlmExerciseI18nContract(...)` failures for missing locale blocks, missing localized names (`sourceExternalId`/`canonicalExerciseId`), and missing `preset_tags` labels
- **Refined**: `mergeExerciseI18nIntoLocales(...)` in `scripts/ingestion/i18nMerge.ts` now accepts optional injected file I/O dependencies (default behavior unchanged) to enable safe unit testing without mutating real locale files.
- **Cleaned**: Runtime-generated ingestion artifacts removed from `data/ingestion/reports/` and `data/ingestion/queues/`; only `.gitkeep` placeholders remain tracked.
- **Verification**:
  - `npm run test:ingestion` passes (3 tests, 0 failures)
  - `npm run ingest -- --config data/ingestion/sources.example.json --dry-run` passes (run `ingestion-20260409-192431-d638c9`: accepted 557, skipped 218, duplicate 100, rejected 0)
  - `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite + PWA generation)

### Tooling Support — Exercise i18n Contract Gating + Deterministic Multi-Candidate Merge (2026-04-09)
- **Fixed**: High-severity i18n merge collapse in `scripts/ingestion/i18nMerge.ts` where updates were reduced to one record per canonical id and could drop valid localized values.
- **Implemented**: Deterministic grouped merge resolution per canonical exercise id:
  - preserve all update candidates per canonical id
  - keep deterministic candidate order (`sourceId` + `sourceExternalId`)
  - resolve localized name/instructions/tag labels by scanning candidates and taking the first non-empty value
  - preserve tag union behavior with deterministic sorting
- **Implemented**: `validateLlmExerciseI18nContract(...)` in `scripts/ingestion/i18nMerge.ts` and wired it into `scripts/runIngestion.ts` for `llm-json` exercise candidates.
  - enforces visibility of prompt-contract gaps for `ca/es/en` locale blocks, localized exercise names, and required `preset_tags` labels
  - emits explicit reasons in ingestion items (review/duplicate/rejected paths) instead of relying on silent fallback only
- **Refactored**: Removed llm-json double-fetch in `scripts/runIngestion.ts`.
  - payload is now loaded once per source and reused for both candidate parsing (`buildLlmJsonCandidatesFromPayload`) and i18n parsing (`parseLlmIngestionI18n`)
- **Updated**: `data/ingestion/llm-example.json` now includes top-level `i18n` with valid `ca/es/en` contract values and canonical exercise enum values, ensuring example verification runs exercise the i18n path.
- **Verification**:
  - `npm run ingest -- --config data/ingestion/sources.example.json --dry-run` passes (run `ingestion-20260409-191146-256c58`: accepted 557, skipped 218, duplicate 100, rejected 0).
  - report confirms llm-json source candidates processed (`Split_Squat_Iso_Hold` + `rehab_knee_stability`) with successful ingestion.
  - `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite build + PWA generation).

### Tooling Support — Exercise Ingestion i18n Automation + Duplicate-Safe Refresh (2026-04-09)
- **Added**: `scripts/ingestion/i18nMerge.ts` to centralize ingestion-time locale merges for exercises/planning with rollback-safe writes.
- **Implemented**: Top-level `i18n` payload parsing for `llm-json` source inputs during `npm run ingest`, including localized exercise names/instructions and localized tag labels.
- **Implemented**: Exercise locale writes to `src/i18n/locales/{ca,es,en}/exercises.json` using canonical exercise id keys.
  - writes exercise names at `exercises.<canonicalExerciseId>`
  - writes optional instructions at `exercises.instructions.<canonicalExerciseId>`
  - keeps deterministic key sorting for stable reruns
- **Implemented**: Tag localization merge into `src/i18n/locales/{ca,es,en}/planning.json` under `planning.preset_tags.<tag>` using ingested exercise tags.
- **Implemented**: Locale fallback chain for all ingestion-managed values:
  - locale payload value -> English payload value -> existing locale value -> humanized fallback
- **Implemented**: Duplicate-safe rerun behavior in `scripts/runIngestion.ts`:
  - duplicate exercise candidates still produce i18n refresh updates for the matched canonical exercise id when schema validation succeeds
  - dedup/report statuses remain unchanged (`duplicate` still reported as duplicate)
- **Updated**: `scripts/runIngestion.ts` to append i18n write paths to report `filesWritten` while preserving existing console summary format.
- **Updated**: `data/ingestion/prompts/exercises-llm-chat.prompt.txt` to explicitly require `i18n.<locale>.preset_tags.<tag>` labels for tags used by generated exercises (ca/es/en).
- **Verification**: `npm run ingest -- --config data/ingestion/sources.example.json --dry-run` passes (run `ingestion-20260409-173248-bf5cbd`: accepted 557, skipped 218, duplicate 100, rejected 0).
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite build + PWA generation).

### Tooling Support — Preset Batch i18n Split + Hardcoded Preset Seeding (2026-04-09)
- **Updated**: `data/ingestion/prompts/presets-llm-chat.prompt.txt` to require strict top-level JSON with both `presets` and `i18n` payloads, fixed ATTACHED typo, and added explicit schema/validation requirements for `ca/es/en` preset name/description plus `preset_tags` labels.
- **Updated**: `data/ingestion/prompts/exercises-llm-chat.prompt.txt` to require strict top-level JSON with both `exercises` and `i18n` payloads, including localized exercise names (`ca/es/en`) and optional localized instructions.
- **Implemented**: `scripts/ingestion/presetGenerator.ts` now supports all response shapes: legacy array, legacy `{ presets: [...] }`, and new `{ presets: [...], i18n: {...} }`.
- **Implemented**: Preset i18n merge/write flow to `src/i18n/locales/{ca,es,en}/planning.json`:
  - writes names/descriptions under `planning.ingested_presets.<canonicalPresetId>.name|description`
  - writes tag labels under `planning.preset_tags.<tag>`
  - applies fallback chain per locale: locale payload -> English payload -> existing locale value -> humanized id/tag fallback
  - guarantees `requiredTags` from accepted presets are represented across all 3 locales
  - allows reruns with duplicate preset IDs to still refresh i18n values when schema validation passes
- **Implemented**: Automatic hardcoded preset seeding from `src/data/presets.ts` into ingestion catalog output (default `data/ingestion/presets/catalog.json`) without duplicate IDs, preserving existing entries and deterministic id sorting.
- **Implemented**: Stable ingestion metadata for seeded hardcoded presets to keep repeated runs consistent.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite production build).
- **Verification**: `npm run presets -- --response-file <tmp> --output <tmp>` preserves expected summary lines (`Report`, `Accepted presets`, `Rejected presets`, `Catalog updated`) and seeds hardcoded preset IDs.

### Tooling Support — Manual LLM Prompt Templates for Ingestion (2026-04-09)
- **Added**: `data/ingestion/prompts/presets-llm-chat.prompt.txt` for manual chat usage that targets the preset batch contract consumed by `scripts/generatePresetBatch.ts` / `scripts/ingestion/presetGenerator.ts`.
- **Added**: `data/ingestion/prompts/exercises-llm-chat.prompt.txt` for manual chat usage that targets the LLM JSON ingestion contract consumed by `scripts/runIngestion.ts` via `scripts/ingestion/adapters/llmJsonAdapter.ts`.
- **Implemented**: Clearly marked variable sections for custom exercise-type instructions in both templates.
- **Implemented**: Strict JSON-only output requirement and explicit schema/enums/constraints aligned with ingestion validators.

### Tooling Maintenance — Step 18 CLI Environment Loading (2026-04-09)
- **Fixed**: `npm run presets` and related Step 18 CLIs could not read `CLAUDE_API_KEY` (and other provider keys) from `.env` because Node entrypoints did not load dotenv.
- **Changed**: Added `import 'dotenv/config'` to `scripts/generatePresetBatch.ts`, `scripts/runIngestion.ts`, and `scripts/generateExercisePhotos.ts`.
- **Changed**: Added `dotenv` as a dev dependency in `package.json` and regenerated `package-lock.json`.
- **Verification**: `npm run presets -- --prompt "test prompt"` now passes the missing-key check and correctly reaches free-tier gating.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite production build + PWA generation).

### Tooling Maintenance — npm Peer Dependency Resolution (2026-04-09)
- **Fixed**: `npm i` ERESOLVE conflict between `vite@8` and `vite-plugin-pwa@1.2.0` peer range.
- **Changed**: Aligned toolchain versions in `package.json` to `vite@^7.3.2` and `@vitejs/plugin-react@^5.2.0`.
- **Updated**: Regenerated lockfile via successful `npm i`.
- **Verification**: `npm i` succeeds without peer errors.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite production build + PWA generation).
- **Verification**: `npm run lint` passes (`tsc --noEmit`).

### Step 16 Planning — Ethical Gamification Documentation Foundation (2026-04-09)
- **Added**: `specs/features/16-ethical-gamification.md` as the Step 16 source-of-truth spec with guardrails, forbidden patterns, Duolingo reference boundaries, pre-execution phases, explicit UI/UX refactor policy, metrics, and completion checklists.
- **Updated**: `specs/STATUS.md` Step 16 checklist with two prerequisite gates: source-of-truth read requirement and pre-execution UI/UX refactor decision gate.
- **Updated**: `tasks/todo.md` with a completed Step 16 documentation foundation checklist to track restoration work.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite production build).

### Step 18 — Multi-Source Content Ingestion Pipeline (2026-04-09)
- **Added**: Core ingestion modules under `scripts/ingestion/` (contracts, adapters, normalizers, validators, dedup, review queue, reports, merge, photo pipeline, preset generator, and shared CLI/path utilities).
- **Added**: Step 18 CLI entrypoints (`scripts/runIngestion.ts`, `scripts/generateExercisePhotos.ts`, `scripts/generatePresetBatch.ts`) and npm scripts (`ingest`, `photos`, `presets`).
- **Added**: Ingestion artifacts/config roots (`data/ingestion/*`) and exercise image placeholder root (`public/exercises/images/.gitkeep`).
- **Implemented**: Deterministic flow with source-license validation, canonical normalization + schema validation, dedup guardrails (registry/slug/similarity/alias map), review gating, dry-run support, and rollback-safe writes.
- **Implemented**: Photo-generation integration from ingestion accepted IDs plus mode-based photo generation (`all`, `missing`, `single`, `from-report`) with free-tier-first provider selection and one-model-per-run metadata locking.
- **Implemented**: Claude preset batch generation flow with output validation and available-exercise ID constraints.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite production build).
- **Verification**: `npm run ingest -- --config data/ingestion/sources.example.json --dry-run` passes (run `ingestion-20260409-115055-a84a7a`: accepted 557, skipped 218, duplicate 100, rejected 0).
- **Verification**: `npm run photos -- --help` and `npm run presets -- --help` both pass offline and print expected CLI usage.

### Step 17 — Formatter + Session Hooks (2026-04-09)
- **Added**: `@biomejs/biome` as the repository formatter/linter baseline.
- **Added**: Biome scripts in `package.json` (`format`, `format:check`, `lint:biome`).
- **Added**: `biome.json` generated from Biome v2 and tuned to project style (2-space indentation, single quotes, semicolons as needed, trailing commas, 100-char line width).
- **Updated**: `.vscode/settings.json` with Biome default formatter + format-on-save and Biome organize-import actions.
- **Added**: `.agents/hooks/hooks.json` with a `session-end` hook that runs `npm run format`.
- **Executed**: Initial repository normalization via `npm run format` (104 files scanned, 58 files fixed).
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite production build).

### Step 18 Planning — Multi-Source Content Ingestion Pipeline (2026-04-08)
- **Planned**: New Step 18 to ingest exercises, presets, and media from multiple sources through provider adapters (external APIs + LLM responses).
- **Planned**: Canonical transformation layer for exercise/preset payloads with strict schema validation before merge.
- **Planned**: Dedup guardrails combining source IDs, slug checks, title+muscle similarity, and alias mapping to avoid duplicate exercises.
- **Planned**: Node image pipeline for one representative photo per exercise with free-tier-first provider abstraction (use Nanobanana only if its free tier is available, otherwise auto-select the best free provider), supporting full regen and incremental generation.
- **Planned**: Image consistency guardrails include passing a style reference image in prompts and using one single model for all exercise images in a generation cycle.
- **Planned**: Preset-batch generation workflow using Claude prompt-in/preset-JSON-out, constrained to currently available exercise IDs.
- **Planned**: Operational safeguards (dry-run, ingest reports, manual review queue, rollback-safe merge process).
- **Added TODO**: Follow-up product item to manually edit LLM-imported plans before import and optionally save them as user presets.

### Weight Selector One-Time Cascade Normalization (2026-04-08)
- **Changed**: Hierarchical inferior-weight auto-selection now triggers only once per equipment group (`manueles`, `barra`) on the first selection-like action.
- **Changed**: After that first cascade, all chip interactions are normalized to isolated per-weight toggle behavior (select/deselect only the clicked weight).
- **Changed**: Custom weight add flow follows the same rule: first add can cascade once, later adds are isolated.
- **Kept**: Defaults remain unselected (`DEFAULT_AVAILABLE_WEIGHTS` empty arrays) and existing i18n usage unchanged.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes with zero errors.

### Weight Selector Hierarchical Selection Update (2026-04-08)
- **Changed**: `DEFAULT_AVAILABLE_WEIGHTS` now initializes `manueles` and `barra` with empty arrays, so weights are never preselected by default.
- **Changed**: `WeightSelector` now auto-selects all inferior weights (same equipment) when selecting an unselected weight chip.
- **Changed**: Custom weight add flow now follows the same hierarchy rule: adding/selecting a custom value also selects all inferior preset/custom weights.
- **Kept**: Deselection remains non-destructive; tapping a selected chip only deselects that chip.
- **Verification**: `npm run build` passes with zero errors.

### Onboarding & UserConfig Refactor (2026-04-09)
- **Removed**: `UserProfile` type and profile step from onboarding — was only used for preset filtering with minimal impact
- **Removed**: `weeklyProgression` from UserConfig — was always overridden by PlanCreator slider
- **Removed**: `availableDaysPerWeek: number` — replaced with `trainingDays: DayOfWeek[]` for specific weekday selection
- **Removed**: Free-text restriction textarea — moved idea to Step 15 (LLM free-form context)
- **Fixed**: Restriction key mismatch — old keys (`knee`, `ankle`, `back`, `shoulder`, `hip`, `wrist`) matched nothing in enrichment data. Now uses `RestrictionCondition` type: `rehab_genoll | rehab_lumbar | rehab_turmell | tendinitis_rotuliana`
- **Fixed**: WeightSelector custom weight UX — custom weights now appear in the toggleable grid after being added
- **Expanded**: Default weight presets — manueles 1-40kg, barra 20-120kg (was 2-32 / 20-100)
- **Changed**: Dashboard session logic — from "today by day-of-week" to "next consecutive uncompleted session"
- **Changed**: PlanCreator — shows all presets (not profile-filtered) with text search and tag filter
- **Changed**: Onboarding — single step instead of 2 (removed Step1Profile), weekday toggle buttons instead of numeric day count
- **Updated**: Settings page — removed profile section, added weekday toggles, uses real restriction conditions
- **Updated**: i18n (ca/es/en) — new restriction labels, weekday names, preset search/tag keys
- **Files changed**: 20+ files across types, data, services, stores, components, pages, i18n

### Pre-Built Exercise Pipeline (2026-04-08)
- **Architecture change:** Exercises are now pre-built at development time instead of enriched at runtime.
- **Added**: `data/raw/free-exercise-db.json` — archived raw source (873 exercises from free-exercise-db)
- **Added**: `scripts/buildExercises.ts` — build-time pipeline that merges raw data + enrichment map + muscle/equipment mappings → produces `public/exercises/exercises.json` (100 enriched exercises)
- **Added**: `npm run build:exercises` script
- **Simplified**: `exerciseLoader.ts` — reduced from 80 lines of runtime processing to 6 lines (fetch + return)
- **Bundle impact**: `exerciseEnrichment.ts` (~960 lines) and mapping tables from `muscleGroups.ts` are now tree-shaken out of the client bundle (no longer imported at runtime)
- **Updated**: `verify.cjs` — now validates against the enriched JSON (source of truth) instead of cross-referencing raw + enrichment
- **Updated**: specs (OVERVIEW.md, STATUS.md, 02-exercises.md) to reflect new data pipeline
- **Data flow**: `data/raw/free-exercise-db.json` + `src/data/exerciseEnrichment.ts` + `src/data/muscleGroups.ts` → `scripts/buildExercises.ts` → `public/exercises/exercises.json`
- **Rationale**: Client no longer downloads 873 raw exercises only to keep 100; no runtime muscle/equipment mapping or enrichment merging. Simpler loader, smaller bundle, faster client startup. Our enriched JSON becomes the true source of truth. Future remote source updates go through the build script.

### Decision 7 — Pre-Built Exercise Pipeline
- **Decided:** `public/exercises/exercises.json` is our source of truth — already enriched, mapped, and ready for client consumption.
- **Build-time script** (`scripts/buildExercises.ts`) takes raw free-exercise-db + enrichment map + muscle/equipment mappings and produces the final JSON.
- **Raw remote data** archived at `data/raw/free-exercise-db.json` for rebuild capability and future source updates.
- **Client loader** is a simple fetch + type assertion — zero processing.
- **Rationale:** The previous model fetched 873 raw exercises, filtered to ~100, applied muscle mappings, equipment mappings, and enrichment merges on every page load. This is wasteful since the data only changes when developers modify enrichment. Moving processing to build-time eliminates runtime cost, reduces bundle size (enrichment map tree-shaken), and establishes our JSON as the canonical source — important when we add custom exercises or additional remote sources in the future.

### Skip Set Button (2026-04-07)
- **Replaced**: `skipExercise` action with `skipSet` in sessionStore — advances one set (not entire exercise), no ExecutedSet record, no rest timer; handles both standard and circuit modes
- **Updated**: useSession hook — exports `skipSet` instead of `skipExercise`
- **Updated**: SetLogger component — added `onSkipSet` prop with secondary-style button inside the component
- **Updated**: Session page — removed standalone skip-exercise button, passes `skipSet` to SetLogger
- **Updated**: i18n keys in all 3 languages — replaced `session.skip_exercise` with `session.skip_set` (ca: "Saltar sèrie", es: "Omitir serie", en: "Skip set")

### Exercise Data Quality Audit (2026-04-07)
- **Added**: `primaryMusclesExtra` and `secondaryMusclesExtra` optional fields to `EnrichmentData` type — allows enrichment to add our custom taxonomy muscles (e.g. `oblics`, `psoes`, `mobilitat_cadera`) that don't exist in free-exercise-db vocabulary
- **Updated**: `exerciseLoader.ts` merges extra muscles with auto-mapped muscles from raw data (with deduplication)
- **Added**: Muscle extras to 37 existing enriched exercises covering all 8 previously empty custom muscle groups: `tibial_anterior`, `psoes`, `oblics`, `estabilitzadors_cadera`, `mobilitat_cadera`, `mobilitat_turmell`, `mobilitat_toracica`, `fascies`
- **Added**: 3 new enriched exercises: `Anterior_Tibialis-SMR`, `Decline_Oblique_Crunch`, `Dumbbell_Side_Bend` (total: 83 enriched)
- **Added**: ca/es/en translations for 3 new exercises
- **Fixed**: EN instruction translations added for 10 exercises (were only in CA/ES)
- **Result**: All 23 muscle groups now have ≥ 3 enriched exercises (previously 8 groups had zero); all 83 exercise name translations complete in 3 languages; 10 exercises have instruction translations in all 3 languages
- **Noted**: `trx` Equipment type has 0 exercises in raw data (candidate for future cleanup)

### Available Weights Configuration and Snapping (2026-04-07)
- **Added**: `AvailableWeights` type and `availableWeights` field to `UserConfig` (per equipment type: `manueles`, `barra`)
- **Added**: `DEFAULT_AVAILABLE_WEIGHTS` constant with sensible defaults for dumbbells and barbell
- **Added**: `snapToAvailableWeight()` pure function in `src/services/planning/weightSnapping.ts` — supports `up`, `down`, `nearest` directions
- **Added**: `getAdjacentWeights()` helper for session UI weight navigation
- **Integrated**: Planning engine (`computeLoadTarget`) now computes and snaps `weightKg` for weight-metric exercises based on user's available weights
- **Added**: `WeightSelector` reusable component — chip-toggle UI for common weights + custom weight input
- **Added**: Available weights section in Settings page (visible when dumbbells or barbell selected)
- **Added**: Available weights section in Onboarding Step 3 (visible when dumbbells or barbell selected)
- **Added**: Weight up/down controls in `ActiveExercise` during session execution using adjacent available weights
- **Added**: `updateCurrentExerciseWeight` action in sessionStore for runtime weight adjustment
- **Added**: i18n keys in all 3 languages (ca/es/en) for available weights UI, onboarding weights, and session weight navigation
- **Updated**: `useUserStore` with `availableWeights` state and `setAvailableWeights` action
- **Updated**: `PlanCreator` passes `availableWeights` when generating plans

### QA Pass (2026-04-05) — Session, Full Plan, and Gemini Prompt
- **Improved**: Pre-session exercise list uses derived (useMemo) list based on executionMode for reactive reordering
- **Fixed**: Circuit mode description — removed "short rest" / "poc descans" / "poco descanso" references from ca/es/en
- **Removed**: Second skip button (skipBlock / "next exercise") — single "skip exercise" button remains in active session
- **Removed**: `skipBlock` action from sessionStore, useSession, and i18n keys
- **Added**: Expandable per-session detail in plan view — compact SessionPreview rows expand to show muscle group targets with sets, reps, RPE, rest
- **Added**: Weekly progression field (0-10 scale) in plan creation configure step with range slider
- **Updated**: Gemini SYSTEM_PROMPT — progression rules tied to 0-10 scale, deload at multiples of 4 weeks at 60%, conservative rehab behavior
- **Updated**: buildUserMessage — includes progression level and deload schedule in prompt
- **Updated**: All progression rules — deload percentage standardized to 60% across linear/undulating/block types
- **Propagated**: weeklyProgression through UserConfig → PlanCreator → planningStore → planningEngine → /api/generate-plan

### QA Pass (2026-04-03) — UX, Language, Planning, Session
- **Improved**: Language selector — replaced button grid with native `<select>` dropdown in BottomNav for mobile scalability
- **Fixed**: Language persistence — added LanguageSelector to Landing and Onboarding pages so language choice persists through the full flow
- **Improved**: Planning muscle-group UX — replaced cycle-click with per-group `<select>` dropdowns in 2-col responsive grid
- **Added**: "Let AI decide" toggle for muscle group priorities in plan creation
- **Added**: Explanation and helper microcopy for muscle group weighting step
- **Added**: Deterministic preset → muscle group preselection (≥25% → High, 10-24% → Medium, <10% → Low)
- **Fixed**: Muscle group selector completeness — replaced hardcoded 13-group `MAIN_MUSCLE_GROUPS` with full 23-group `ALL_MUSCLE_GROUPS` from `muscleGroups.ts` so all groups (including secondary-only like `avantbras`, `oblics`, `trapezi`, `mobilitat_turmell`) are selectable in PlanCreator
- **Added**: Custom presets — save, load, and delete user-created presets from IndexedDB
- **Added**: Pre-session preview page (SessionPreStart) — shows exercises, sets/reps/weights before session starts
- **Added**: Delete exercises from pre-session preview
- **Added**: Execution mode selector (Standard/Circuit) moved to pre-session preview only
- **Locked**: Execution mode cannot be changed once session is active (read-only circuit indicator)
- **Added**: Exercise instruction i18n — component-level fallback from translated instructions to raw English
- **Added**: Catalan and Spanish translations for 10 representative exercise instructions
- **Added**: Exercise image architecture — ExerciseImage type, placeholder SVG, representative image in session and pre-start views
- **Updated**: UX reviewer agent — added "Language as dropdown" criterion

### QA Pass (2026-03-31) — Complete
- **Fixed**: Exercise title translation bug — `nameKey` had double namespace prefix (`exercises:exercises:...`)
- **Fixed**: Session viewport overlap — buttons hidden under sticky bottom nav when instructions expanded (pb-8 → pb-24)
- **Added**: Session cancel/pause/discard — cancel button, save partial progress, or discard entirely
- **Added**: Execution mode toggle (Standard vs Circuit) — circuit mode cycles through exercises one set at a time
- **Moved**: Language selector from fixed top-right position into "More" menu in bottom nav bar
- **Added**: Settings page (`/settings`) — edit profile, equipment, restrictions, days/week, minutes/session
- **Removed**: Weekly view from Planning tab — only month view remains
- **Improved**: Quick session — expandable muscle group selector with duration picker
- **Added**: Muscle group pre-selection with priority weights (high/medium/low) in plan creation
- **Fixed**: Plan view compact mode — shows all muscle groups instead of 3 + ellipsis

## Architecture Decisions — Full Rationale

### Decision 1 — Remove Server-Side AI (Gemini API)
- **Decided:** `api/generate-plan.ts` and the `planningEngine.ts` API client are removed.
- Replaced by two user-facing paths: Deterministic Planning and User-Owned LLM Assistant (see below).
- Rationale: eliminates infrastructure cost and API key management; shifts control to the user.

### Decision 2 — Deterministic Planning Engine
The new plan creation wizard lets the user configure everything manually; an on-device algorithm builds the plan.

**User inputs (wizard steps):**
1. Sessions per week + available minutes per session.
2. Muscle groups to target.
3. Specific exercises per muscle group — catalog is pre-filtered by the user's owned equipment/restrictions (from onboarding).
4. Option to start from a **preset** (built-in or user-saved) and adjust from there.

**Algorithm rules:**
- Each exercise in the catalog declares a `progressionMetric: 'weight' | 'reps' | 'seconds'`. The algorithm increments the relevant metric over the mesocycle.
- Random selection within the filtered exercise pool per muscle group.
- Anti-repeat: no exercise may appear in session N *and* session N+1 (two consecutive sessions).
- No exercise from the same muscle group is repeated within the same session.
- Duration constraint: total estimated sets × average set time ≤ user's available minutes.

### Decision 3 — User-Owned LLM Assistant Path ("Let AI do the job")
An alternative to the wizard for users who prefer AI-assisted configuration.

**Flow:**
1. App generates a **prompt template** describing the task and JSON contract, plus a **CSV attachment** containing:
   - Exercise catalog filtered by user's equipment (id, name, muscles, progressionMetric, equipment).
   - User's owned equipment and restrictions.
   - The expected JSON schema the app will validate against.
2. Numbered step-by-step instructions are shown so the user knows exactly how to proceed.
3. User copies the prompt + attaches the CSV into their LLM of choice (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
4. User copies the LLM's JSON output and pastes it back into the app.
5. App validates the JSON against the schema before importing; shows clear errors if invalid.
- **Note (idea):** for any large reference data that would bloat the prompt but is stable, pack it into the CSV instead of inline text to avoid clipboard size limits.

### Decision 4 — Presets
- Built-in presets cover the most common training profiles (already partially implemented).
- User can load a preset as a starting point and modify it before saving.
- User-saved presets persist in IndexedDB (already implemented); extend to cover the full new wizard configuration shape.

### Decision 5 — Static Data Serving (exercises, presets, i18n)
- **Decided:** Keep static files served directly from Vercel's edge CDN. No serverless function endpoints.
- Exercises: `/public/exercises/exercises.json` fetched at runtime, merged with enrichment client-side.
- Presets + i18n: bundled in the JS bundle (tiny, change infrequently).
- **Rationale:** Serverless functions incur cold-start latency + function invocation costs. Static files on Vercel CDN are free, faster (no compute), and sufficient for this app's data size (~97 exercises, 5 presets, 3 locales). A Vercel Function approach only pays off at scale (thousands of exercises, frequent data updates, multiple external consumers).
- **Reverted:** A prior implementation (Step 13) added `api/exercises.ts`, `api/presets.ts`, `api/i18n/[locale].ts` with ETag/Cache-Control + client-side localStorage cache — removed because it increased infra cost with no real benefit at this scale.

### Decision 6 — Ethical Gamification (kept, scope defined)
- Achievements tied exclusively to sustainable habits: consistency streaks, deload compliance, warm-up completion, injury-safe progression.
- Non-speculative points/tokens used only for in-app milestones and reflection prompts — never for pay-to-win or pressure mechanics.
- Streak recovery safeguards so missing a session does not trigger guilt loops.
- Optional patronage model (tips, supporter badge) with no paywalled core functionality.
- Anti-addictive guardrails defined before any engagement mechanic ships.

## Architecture Migration — Fase 1 (Complete)
- Migrated from user-provided Claude API key (browser-side) to server-side Gemini 2.5 Flash via Vercel Serverless Function
- Onboarding simplified from 3 steps to 2 (removed Claude API key step)
- Removed crypto-js dependency (no longer needed)
- Created `api/generate-plan.ts` — Vercel Serverless Function (POST, Gemini 2.5 Flash, rate limiting)
- Created `src/services/planning/planningEngine.ts` — frontend service (calls /api/generate-plan)
- Updated all specs, i18n, and agent configs to reflect new architecture

- [x] Push `main` + `develop` to GitHub (user completes after repo creation)

### Step 13 — ❌ Reverted (Static Data API)
- Implemented and then reverted. Serverless function endpoints (`api/exercises.ts`, `api/presets.ts`, `api/i18n/[locale].ts`) + client-side localStorage cache added unnecessary infra cost.
- Static files on Vercel CDN are free and faster (no cold start, no function invocations).
- Exercise data (~97 enriched exercises), presets (5), and i18n (3 locales) are too small to justify serverless endpoints.
- Decision documented in Decision 5 above.

## Known Issues — Resolved

### Fixed — IndexedDB boolean index bug (2026-03-31)
- `getActiveMesocycle()` used `IDBKeyRange.only(true)` on the `by-active` index, but IndexedDB does not support boolean values as index keys (valid types: number, string, Date, ArrayBuffer, Array).
- `IDBKeyRange.only(true)` throws `DataError`, causing `saveGenerated()` to fail silently (caught by try/catch) — nothing saved to IDB and UI never updated.
- **Fix:** Changed `getActiveMesocycle()` to use `getAll()` + `find()` instead of the boolean index query. The `by-active` index remains in the schema (harmless, removing would require DB migration).

## Step 15 — User-Owned LLM Assistant (2026-04-08)

### Summary
Implemented the full LLM Assistant feature as an alternative plan creation path in the PlanCreator wizard. Users can generate a prompt + CSV exercise catalog, paste it into their own LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), and import the resulting JSON plan back into the app.

### Files Created
- `src/services/planning/llmAssistantService.ts` — Service layer: LLM types, prompt template generation, CSV catalog generation, JSON validation with markdown-fence stripping, conversion to Mesocycle
- `src/components/planning/LLMAssistant.tsx` — UI component: personal notes (persisted in IndexedDB), prompt display with copy, CSV download, JSON paste textarea, validation results display, import button

### Files Modified
- `src/stores/planningStore.ts` — Added `setGeneratedPreview` action for direct mesocycle injection
- `src/components/planning/PlanCreator.tsx` — Added `'llm-assistant'` to Step union, "Use LLM Assistant" button on configure step, LLMAssistant rendering
- `src/i18n/locales/ca/planning.json` — Added `llm.*` keys (38 keys)
- `src/i18n/locales/es/planning.json` — Added `llm.*` keys (38 keys)
- `src/i18n/locales/en/planning.json` — Added `llm.*` keys (38 keys)

### Key Decisions
- Prompt template is always English (best LLM performance); UI chrome is i18n'd
- Personal notes persisted via existing `configRepository` KV store (`llmPersonalNotes` key)
- Validation includes 7 structural error rules and 4 warning rules per spec
- Markdown code fence stripping handles ```json and plain ``` fences
- CSV uses RFC 4180 format with proper escaping
